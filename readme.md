# OpenTinyHome
A repository for free-and-open-source tiny-house blueprints in the form of complete 3D-models that only contain realistic dimensions for building materials.

## The Nano
A reference tiny house blueprint designed to be as small as possible, yet extremely well-insulated. The plan includes layouts for electrical (solar) and water systems. [Model](the_nano/model.skp) | [Materials](the_nano/materials.ods)
