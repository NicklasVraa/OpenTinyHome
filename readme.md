# OpenTinyHome
A repository for free-and-open-source tiny-house blueprints in the form of complete and highly detailed 3D-models that only contain realistic dimensions for building materials.

## The Motivation
The intent with this project is to enable anyone to build a reliable and up-to-code home for themselves. This biggest hurdle to doing just this is acquiring a complete plan.

The undertaking of producing a solid plan by oneself requires either:
- Degrees in **carpentry**, **electrics**, **plumbings** and **engineering**
- A lifetime of practical **DIY experience** and know-how.
- Or months of dedicated **research**.

Plans are available online, but they are very rarely complete and almost always behind paywalls. Very often, they require experience in reading traditional 2D blueprints.

The plans that available in this repository will assume (and therefore require) only two things, as they should: The ability to see and read.

## The Roadmap
- [x] Establish a protocol for designing accurate 3D-models of homes in Sketchup.
- [ ] Produce a complete 3D model of a standard tiny house to serve as both the first available plan and as a reference for other future plans that may be produced by anyone wanting to contribute.
- [ ] Produce a LEGO-like instruction manual that detail every step of building the reference tiny house.

## Design Constraints
Every home design that will be published here must adhere to the following design constraints:
- Buildable with only standard materials and tools.
- Well-insulated construction with thick walls and roof.
- Roof surfaces that support installing photovoltaic panels at the optimum angle.
- Design must include plans for utilities, i.e. electrics, water and heat.

## The Nano
A reference tiny house blueprint designed to be as small as possible, yet extremely well-insulated. The plan includes layouts for electrical and water systems. [Model](the_nano/model.skp) | [Materials](the_nano/materials.ods)
